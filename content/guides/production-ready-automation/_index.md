The Production Ready Automation (PRA) package from Cumulus Networks provides several examples of a fully operationalized, automated data center and includes:

- A standard datacenter reference topology for all examples
- A full {{<exlink url="https://www.vagrantup.com/" text="Vagrant" >}} and {{<exlink url="https://libvirt.org/" text="libvirt" >}} simulation of the Cumulus Networks reference topology, {{<exlink url="https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/goldenturtle/cldemo2/" text="cldemo2" >}}, that provides the foundational physical infrastructure and bootstrap configuration to support and demonstrate Cumulus Linux features and technologies
- A variety of golden standard, production grade, EVPN-VXLAN architecture reference configurations
- Best practice {{<exlink url="https://www.ansible.com/" text="Ansible" >}} automation and infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Working examples of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using {{<exlink url="https://gitlab.com/" text="GitLab" >}}
- CI/CD testing powered by NetQ Cloud

You can use this PRA package as a learning resource and as a starting template to implement these features, technologies and operational workflows in your Cumulus Linux network environments.

## Defining Production Ready

Cumulus Networks has purposefully defined these published configurations, automations and integrations as *production ready* to show that they are actively deployed in the production networks of dozens of Cumulus customers. All the components of the PRA are used as the starting point for all paid {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/consulting/" text="Cumulus Services" >}} engagements. Any modifications or learnings from those customer engagements are committed back into the PRA repositories. The PRA repositories always reflect the current best practices for datacenter automation and configuration.

## The Value of Production Ready Automation

Cumulus Networks created the PRA to assist customers along the Cumulus Linux automation and deployment journey. You can use the PRA content directly against a new or existing datacenter deployment or as a best practice implementation.

The vast majority of customers deploy EVPN-VXLAN networks together with common features including DNS, SNMP, Syslog, NetQ and NTP. This list will grow over time as we identify more common deployments and best practices.

Not only do the PRA collections include full Ansible configurations for these features, but it also includes {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-linux/Installation-Management/Zero-Touch-Provisioning-ZTP/" text="ZTP scripts" >}}, high-fidelity simulation with Vagrant and Cumulus VX, and a fully automated network testing and validation suite.

All of this is stored in a Git repository allowing for a modern infrastructure as code definition.

## Infrastructure as Code

The PRA package contains examples of best practice Ansible automation and infrastructure as code. A completely stock Ansible core installation is used without any vendor specific or third-party plugins. Examples of Ansible best practices using roles, highly granular templates, and structured variables show how you can store your network configurations as a highly scalable version of infrastructure as code. It is that base code that is rendered by the automation engine to produce the final configurations that exist on the network devices.

Adopting infrastructure as code allows for offline backups, simple collaboration and easy revision control. The configuration and automation stored within Git are the definitive source of truth for the infrastructure.

## Production Ready Automation Components

Cumulus Networks made a number of specific tooling choices as part of building PRA. These choices come from years of experience building and automating customer networks as well as experience in the field speaking with customers running both homogeneous Cumulus Linux networks as well as mixed vendor networks.

### Automation with Ansible

Ansible is used as the automation tool of choice due to its growing adoption by the broader networking community. Ansible as an organization has also put significant weight behind embracing network automation. The agentless nature of Ansible allows it to work well with legacy networking devices as well as modern networking systems like Cumulus Linux.

Although Cumulus Linux does not rely on any networking specific Ansible modules and instead uses the off the shelf Linux server modules, Ansible has been the easiest for network engineers to learn and fits well with the network engineering (push) model of configuration management.

We see a growing adoption of {{<exlink url="https://www.saltstack.com/" text="Saltstack" >}} due to its ability to have both an agentless push-based model as well as an on-box agent based pull model. We still see a vast majority of our customers adopting Ansible and these customers are very satisfied with this automation tool.

### Network Simulation with Vagrant, KVM and Libvirt

A number of different virtualization options, both free and commercial, exist in the marketplace today. We found that only KVM and Libvirt meet the needs of multiple VMs with a large number of interfaces (upto 128 per VM) as well as the ability to cluster simulations across servers transparently. This allows us to simulate a network of any size, regardless of the power of any single server.

The use of Vagrant allows us to define the VM settings, such as memory, CPU and binary image, as well as the complex network connectivity of the VMs as code. This allows us to easily share the lab definitions in the form of a Vagrantfile as well as to version control with Git.

### GitLab Source Code Control

There are two major, public, source code repositories: GitHub and GitLab. We selected GitLab based on their CI/CD framework. GitLab relies on a *GitLab Runner*, an agent that runs on a server that runs your CI tests. Our network simulation must run in VMs and not inside of containers, due to the need for a specific VM image (Cumulus VX) and multiple interconnected interfaces. Most *build* tools like {{<exlink url="https://travis-ci.com/" text="Travis-CI" >}} rely on stand alone Docker containers to test software. Our needs are more complex than a third-party build tool can support.

We run the GitLab Runner on servers pre-installed with KVM, libvirt and Vagrant, and these servers are dedicated to network simulations. When changes are made to our GitLab source code repository, GitLab notifies the Runner agent, triggers the creation of a network simulation, and runs the associated network tests. The other advantage to using the GitLab Runner is that it operates on a pull model, where the Runner reaches outbound from the server and checks with GitLab to see if there are any jobs to run. This is in contrast to {{<exlink url="https://www.jenkins.io/" text="Jenkins" >}}, which is triggered based on inbound webhooks. This creates challenges in enterprise environments where inbound HTTP requests might not be allowed due to NAT or firewall policies. There are no technical limitations in using Jenkins as a build server.

### Reference Topology

The Cumulus Networks reference topology provides a common and consistent preconfigured spine and leaf base network topology, which serves as the basis for all supported Cumulus Networks demos and golden standards. This reference topology is intended to be a blank slate with minimal configuration to prepare the simulation to receive additional deployment and provisioning that demonstrates a feature or represents a fully operational production network.

The Cumulus Networks reference topology provides a complete two-tier spine and leaf topology. It also includes a complete out-of-band management. The devices include:

- Four Cumulus Linux 3.7 spines
- Four Cumulus Linux 3.7 leafs
- Eight Ubuntu 18.04 servers
- Two Cumulus Linux 3.7 border leafs
- Two Cumulus Linux 3.7 *fw* devices that provide a placeholder for *policy* devices
- One Ubuntu 18.04 out-of-band management server (oob-mgmt-server)
- One Cumulus Linux 3.7 out-of-band management switch (oob-mgmt-switch)
- One Cumulus NetQ Cloud virtual appliance (netq-ts)

{{<img src="/images/guides/cldemo2-diagram.png" >}}

When you start the reference topology simulation environment, all interfaces (except for the out-of-band management network) are unconfigured and administratively down. This is the default configuration of Cumulus Linux. The golden standard configurations and demos provide interface and routing protocol configurations that are applied to this simulation topology.

The Cumulus Networks reference topology is included with every officially-supported Cumulus Linux demo. To see a full example of the PRA, use one of the {{<link text="EVPN-VXLAN golden standard demos" title="#golden standard demos" >}}.

Although your datacenter topology might be different, all the concepts and principles described in the PRA automations stay the same. For more details on how to customize PRA, refer to {{<link title="Customize Production Ready Automation" text="Customize Production Ready Automation">}}.

<!-- For information on how to build a package like this, or contribute your own demo or environment for the base Cumulus Networks reference topology, refer to the Contributors Guide.-->

## Golden Standard Demos

Cumulus Networks currently provides three officially-supported demo solutions to overlay and provision the reference topology. These demos are all EVPN-VXLAN environments and each performs tenant routing in a different style.

The golden standard demos and the underlying base reference topology are officially hosted on GitLab in the Golden Turtle folder of the {{<exlink url="https://gitlab.com/cumulus-consulting/goldenturtle" text="Cumulus Consulting GitLab group">}}.

{{%notice note%}}

The name *Golden Turtle* comes from the idea of a *golden reference* and the rocket turtle, which is the Cumulus Networks mascot. Golden reference + rocket turtle = Golden Turtle.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

As network operations become more programmatic and automated, and in combination with a robust simulation platform, CI/CD and DevOps style workflows are supplanting legacy workflows. You can test configuration changes automatically in a simulated environment to allow for more rapid and robust change management workflows. The PRA package provides an example CI/CD pipeline implemented on GitLab with the CI network testing and validation powered by {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq/" text="Cumulus NetQ">}}.
